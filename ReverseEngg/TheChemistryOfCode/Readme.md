# CAPTURE THE FLAG - THE CHEMISTRY OF CODE  

---

## Problem Description  
During a discussion with hackers, one idea stuck: every hacker must be able to understand code, no matter how cryptic.  

Hidden within obfuscated Rust code is a function that holds the flag. But it only unlocks when you reverse its logic and uncover the correct username and password.  

Do you have what it takes to decode this tangled masterpiece? Dive into the chemistry of code and prove your skills.  

**Hint:** Some secrets are worth their salt.

## Given Data  
- A zip file: `TheChemistryOfCode.zip`  
- Inside the zip, a Rust script with obfuscated logic  

---

## How to Solve  

### **1. Extracting the Encrypted Zip**  
First, extract the provided zip file using:  

```bash
unzip TheChemistryOfCode.zip
```

This reveals a Rust script that contains an encrypted function.  

---

### **2. Analyzing the Rust Code**  
Open the Rust file and examine the structure. You will notice:  
- A function that checks a username and password.  
- Some form of obfuscation (possibly XOR, Base64, or a hashing mechanism).  
- A hidden flag that is only revealed if correct input is given.  

Since manually analyzing obfuscated code is inefficient, we use automation to reverse the logic.  

---

### **3. Writing the Reverse Engineering Script: `solve.py`**  
I created `solve.py` to automate the reversing process. Hereâ€™s what it does:  

1. **Extracts Key Functions**  
   - Reads the Rust script.  
   - Identifies important functions related to authentication and encryption.  

2. **Reverses the Logic**  
   - If the Rust script uses hashing, `solve.py` attempts to brute-force or find hash collisions.  
   - If it's an encryption scheme (like XOR or Base64), `solve.py` deciphers it.  
   - If it contains a static check (e.g., `if username == "xyz"`), `solve.py` extracts the expected values.  

3. **Generates the Correct Input**  
   - Based on the reversed logic, `solve.py` generates the correct username and password.  

4. **Extracts the Flag**  
   - Once correct input is found, the script simulates the Rust function to extract the flag.  

---

### **4. Running `solve.py`**  
Execute the script with:  

```bash
python3 solve.py
```

This automatically bypasses the authentication check and retrieves the hidden flag.  

---

## The Flag  
After running `solve.py`, we successfully extract:  

```bash
ACECTF{4ppr3n71c3_w4l73r_wh1t3}
```

## Conclusion  
This challenge demonstrates the power of reverse engineering in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. By breaking down obfuscated logic, analyzing patterns, and automating the decryption process, we can successfully retrieve hidden information.  

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
